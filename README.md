The work consists of 4 files with the .py extension:
* **frame_ruta_1.py**: processing of a frame from the video `ruta_1.mp4`
* **ruta_1.py**: extension of the code in `frame_ruta_1.py` to the entire video
* **frame_ruta_2.py**: processing of a frame from the video `ruta_2.mp4`
* **ruta_2.py**: extension of the code in `frame_ruta_2.py` to the entire video

Additionally, the original videos and the videos obtained after running the work for the last time are included:
* `ruta_1.mp4` and `ruta_2.mp4` are the original videos
* `ruta_1_lineas.mp4` and `ruta_2_lineas.mp4` are the videos obtained from the last execution

This repository also contains two files provided by the course with an example code for recording and reading videos.

**To run the work, execute the code in the files `ruta_1.py` and `ruta_2.py`.**


This repository contains two Python scripts designed to process and analyze PNG images for different purposes.
